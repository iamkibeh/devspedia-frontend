# Introduction

- During our time at Moringa, we saw that junior devs need a platform for documenting their progress as they learn software engineering. For juniors who are just starting out, the already existing sites, like Medium, can be intimidating.

# Description

- We developed a website application that offers students a place to publish articles and track their experience. This will allow us to establish an even wider community because any internet user will be able to subscribe to access more content.

# Technology Used

- CSS - which was used to style the pages .

- React - building frontend dynamic and interactive pages where users can interact with the application.

- ruby on rails -developing backend, where data are stored and fetched from the frontend.
